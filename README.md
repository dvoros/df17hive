# Budapest Data Forum 2017 - Hive Workshop

This repository contains all the training material that was part of
the Hive workshop on Budapest Data Forum 2017.

On the [wiki's main page](https://github.com/dvoros/df17hive/wiki) you'll
find the transcript of the workshop with all the queries we were running and
some explanations.

There is a separate [summary page](https://github.com/dvoros/df17hive/wiki/Hive-Query-Language) on the query language that's intended to be
used as a reference, with examples for all the query types we've seen during
the workshop.

In the [discofull.db folder](https://github.com/dvoros/df17hive/tree/master/discofull.db)
you'll find the Discogs data dump of 2017.06.01 as three ORC tables. For the
schema and usage examples see the end of the wiki. To get the original XML dataset,
visit http://data.discogs.com/.
